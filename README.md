# Movie-Finder
"Movie Finder" application that allows users to search for movies and view information about them. The application should have the following features:

Users can search for movies by entering a keyword or title in a search bar.
The application should display a list of movies that match the search query.
Users can click on a movie to view detailed information about it, such as its synopsis, cast, and rating.
The application should also display related movies that users might be interested in.
Users can save their favorite movies to a list for later viewing.
You can also add additional features to this project, such as:

A filter that allows users to sort movies by genre or release date.
A "watchlist" feature that allows users to save movies they want to watch in the future.
Integration with a third-party API, such as the OMDB API, to retrieve movie data.
